// Leetcode number - 781
//Explanation - There is a forest with an unknown number of rabbits. We asked n rabbits "How many rabbits have the same color as you?"
and collected the answers in an integer array answers where answers[i] is the answer of the ith rabbit.
Given the array answers, return the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.

// Normal Explaination :
Here we are going to a forest and asking the rabbit that "Like you How many rabbits are their?"
I asked three rabbits they give the answers as [1,1,2]
the logic is, if the rabbits are give the same number then we are adding the number + themsevles
-- 1 + 1
-- 2 + 1
then total number of rabbits are 5.
Like as [10,10,10]
if the rabbits are same then number of rabbits + themselves then 
-- 10 + 1
then total number of rabbits are 11.
